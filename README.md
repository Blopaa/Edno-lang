# Edno

### what's Edno ?
Edno it's a new programming language built in typescript, with the idea to learn how languages work in a simple way, this way being a useful project to easily learn basic parts of a programming language, being written in a readable way and being commented, the main idea is to focus on the backend (REST APIs, etc) and being mainly the transpilation towards JavaScript or TypeScript, although collaboration is always welcome to increase support for other languages.

---

### Current Focus

currently working on the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), polishing the lexer and adding new tokens for new functionalities.

---

### Roadmap

in the future we hope to implement the interpreter to be able to transpile to another programming language, build some lexers for other languages to transpile to Edno, and in a more distant future to implement a compiler.

---

### How To Run it

there is currently no concrete way to execute it as it is under development but you can use the lexer by calling the function and adding a DSL as a parameter in a string
